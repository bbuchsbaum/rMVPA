# Introduction

Standard Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) compares neural response patterns with model‑based similarity structures. In practice, you may want stronger control over the feature space, or more efficient handling of distance vectors and block structure. This vignette introduces two specialized variants in `rMVPA`—Feature‑Based RSA and Vector‑Based RSA—and shows when they offer advantages over standard RSA.

# Feature-Based RSA

## Overview

Feature‑Based RSA is useful when you have a well‑defined feature space for your stimuli and want to directly map neural activity into that space—for example, reconstructing semantic or visual features from brain responses. Rather than correlating similarity matrices, the method learns a mapping from neural patterns to feature dimensions and evaluates how well those features are recovered.

## Key differences from standard RSA

The core distinction is that Feature‑Based RSA predicts feature values directly, whereas standard RSA compares similarity structures. Outputs are therefore different: standard RSA produces associations between RDMs, while Feature‑Based RSA yields predicted feature values per stimulus. This makes Feature‑Based RSA a natural choice for reconstruction tasks, while standard RSA remains ideal for testing theoretical representational models.

## Implementation Example

Let's walk through a complete example:

```{r}
## Generate data and weakly-correlated features
# Synthetic dataset: 6x6x6, 50 observations (4 blocks)
data_out <- rMVPA::gen_sample_dataset(D = c(6,6,6), nobs = 50, blocks = 4, nlevels = 2)
print(data_out)

set.seed(123)
n_stimuli  <- 50
n_features <- 5

# Latent factors shared between features and brain data (weak signal)
Z <- matrix(rnorm(n_stimuli * 2), n_stimuli, 2)

# Build a weakly-correlated feature matrix: F = 0.5 * (Z %*% B) + 0.5 * noise
B <- matrix(rnorm(2 * n_features), 2, n_features)
feature_matrix <- 0.5 * (Z %*% B) + 0.5 * matrix(rnorm(n_stimuli * n_features), n_stimuli, n_features)
feature_matrix <- base::scale(feature_matrix)
colnames(feature_matrix) <- paste0("feature_", 1:n_features)

# Create stimulus labels
stim_labels <- paste0("stim_", 1:n_stimuli)

# Create a subtle latent signal in the brain data driven by the same Z
mask_vol <- data_out$dataset$mask
# Extract logical mask values and indices
mask_vals <- as.logical(neuroim2::values(mask_vol))
mask_idx <- which(mask_vals)

# Extract masked voxel-by-time matrix from NeuroVec (V x T)
vol_list <- neuroim2::vols(data_out$dataset$train_data)
datamat  <- do.call(cbind, lapply(vol_list, function(v) as.numeric(v[mask_idx])))

# Two random spatial patterns within the mask
set.seed(124)
p1 <- rnorm(length(mask_idx))
p2 <- rnorm(length(mask_idx))
p1 <- p1 / sd(p1); p2 <- p2 / sd(p2)

# Inject weak signal into brain data: X <- X + 0.2 * (p1 %*% t(Z1)) + 0.2 * (p2 %*% t(Z2))
datamat <- datamat + p1 %*% t(0.2 * Z[,1]) + p2 %*% t(0.2 * Z[,2])

# Repackage as a NeuroVec using the existing space and logical mask
train_vec <- neuroim2::SparseNeuroVec(datamat, neuroim2::space(data_out$dataset$train_data), mask = mask_vals)
dset <- mvpa_dataset(train_vec, mask = mask_vol)

# Create feature RSA design from the correlated feature matrix
feature_design <- feature_rsa_design(
  F = feature_matrix,
  labels = stim_labels
)

# Create cross-validation structure using the block information
crossval <- blocked_cross_validation(data_out$design$block_var)

# Create feature RSA model
feature_model <- feature_rsa_model(
  dataset = dset,
  design = feature_design,
  method = "pls",  # Partial Least Squares
  crossval = crossval  # Add cross-validation
)

# Create proper region mask from the dataset's mask
mask_vol <- data_out$dataset$mask
nvox <- sum(mask_vol)
region_mask <- neuroim2::NeuroVol(
  sample(1:3, size = nvox, replace = TRUE),  # 3 regions
  space(mask_vol),
  indices = which(mask_vol > 0)
)

# Run regional analysis
results <- run_regional(feature_model, region_mask)

# Examine results
print(results$performance_table)
```

## Available methods

Feature‑Based RSA supports several estimators. PLS finds components that maximize covariance between brain data and features, and works well when features are correlated. PCA reduces the feature space before regression, providing a compact, interpretable basis. GLMNet (elastic net) adds regularization that helps with feature selection and multicollinearity.

```{r}
# Compare different methods
methods <- c("pls", "pca", "glmnet")
results_list <- lapply(methods, function(method) {
  model <- feature_rsa_model(
    dataset = dset,
    design = feature_design,
    method = method,
    crossval = crossval  # Add cross-validation
  )
  run_regional(model, region_mask)
})

# Compare performance
for (i in seq_along(methods)) {
  cat("\nMethod:", methods[i], "\n")
  print(results_list[[i]]$performance_table)
}
```

# Vector-Based RSA

## Overview

Vector‑Based RSA starts from pre‑computed distance matrices and operates directly on vectorized distances. It is particularly helpful when you need to ignore within‑block comparisons or scale to large datasets—it avoids materializing full similarity matrices and handles blocks efficiently.

## Key differences from standard RSA

Compared to standard RSA, the vector approach (i) works on distance vectors instead of full matrices, (ii) builds block‑wise exclusions into the workflow, and (iii) reduces memory use by retaining only the necessary comparisons. These properties make it a good fit for high‑resolution or long‑duration datasets.

## Implementation Example

```{r}
# Create distance matrix for stimuli
stim_distances <- as.matrix(dist(feature_matrix))
rownames(stim_distances) <- stim_labels

# Create block structure (e.g., runs)
blocks <- rep(1:5, length.out = n_stimuli)

# Create vector RSA design
vector_design <- vector_rsa_design(
    D = stim_distances,
    labels = stim_labels,
    block_var = blocks
)

# Create vector RSA model
vector_model <- vector_rsa_model(
  dataset = dset,
  design = vector_design,
  distfun = cordist(),  # Correlation distance
  rsa_simfun = "pearson"
)

# Run analysis
results_vector <- run_regional(vector_model, region_mask)

# Examine results
print(results_vector$performance_table)
```

## Efficient Block Handling

Vector-Based RSA automatically handles block structure:

```{r}
# Compare with different block structures
block_sizes <- c(5, 10)
results_blocks <- lapply(block_sizes, function(size) {
  blocks <- rep(1:(n_stimuli/size), each = size)
  design <- vector_rsa_design(
    D = stim_distances,
    labels = stim_labels,
    block_var = blocks
  )
  model <- vector_rsa_model(
    dataset = dset,
    design = design,
    distfun = cordist()
  )
  run_regional(model, region_mask)
})

# Compare results
for (i in seq_along(block_sizes)) {
  cat("\nBlock size:", block_sizes[i], "\n")
  print(results_blocks[[i]]$performance_table)
}
```

# When to Use Each Method

## Feature‑Based RSA

Choose Feature‑Based RSA when you have a meaningful feature space and care about predicting or reconstructing those dimensions from neural activity (e.g., semantic features in language regions, low‑level visual features in early visual cortex).

## Vector‑Based RSA

Use Vector‑Based RSA for large datasets or when block handling is central to your design. Working with vectorized distances keeps memory use in check and makes across‑block comparisons straightforward.

## Standard RSA

Standard RSA remains the best choice when your primary goal is to test theoretical similarity structures and neither strict block handling nor extreme memory efficiency is required.

# Summary

`rMVPA` offers three complementary RSA workflows: standard RSA for model testing, Feature‑Based RSA for direct feature reconstruction, and Vector‑Based RSA for efficient block‑aware distance comparisons. Pick the approach that matches your research goal, data structure, and computational budget.
