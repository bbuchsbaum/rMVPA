\title{Get Training Indices for a Fold}
\usage{
train_indices(obj, fold_num, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A cross-validation specification object (e.g., inheriting from `cross_validation`).}

\item{fold_num}{An integer specifying the fold number for which to retrieve training indices.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to methods.}
}
\value{
An integer vector of training indices.
}
\description{
An S3 generic method to retrieve the training sample indices for a specific fold 
from a cross-validation specification object.
}
\examples{
cval <- kfold_cross_validation(len = 20, nfolds = 4)
train_indices(cval, 1)
}
