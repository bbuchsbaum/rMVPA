\arguments{
\item{group_A}{List of NeuroVol/NeuroSurface maps for group A. All maps must share
the same spatial grid/geometry; if maps carry sparse indices, those indices must match.}

\item{group_B}{Optional list of NeuroVol/NeuroSurface maps for group B (same requirements as group_A).}

\item{mask}{Mask object for volumetric data (NeuroVol or logical/numeric vector).
Required for volumetric inputs; optional for surface inputs.}

\item{dims}{Optional spatial dimensions for volumetric masks given as vectors.}

\item{k}{Number of components.}

\item{lambda}{Spatial regularization strength (0 = none).}

\item{graph}{Optional graph Laplacian list (from build_graph_laplacian). If `graph$A`
is weighted, set `graph$weighted=TRUE` to preserve weights; otherwise edges are binarized.}

\item{neighbors}{Neighborhood size for volumetric adjacency (6/18/26).}

\item{na_action}{How to handle NA values in maps: "zero" or "error".}

\item{return_maps}{Logical; return component maps as NeuroVol/NeuroSurface.}

\item{return_data}{Logical; include the data matrix in the result.}

\item{component_test}{NULL to skip, TRUE for defaults, or a list of arguments
passed to spatial_nmf_component_test.}

\item{global_test}{NULL to skip, TRUE for defaults, or a list of arguments
passed to spatial_nmf_global_test.}

\item{stability}{NULL to skip, TRUE for defaults, or a list of arguments
passed to spatial_nmf_stability.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to spatial_nmf_fit.}
}
\value{
A list with fields:
  \itemize{
    \item fit: spatial_nmf_fit object.
    \item components: list of spatial component maps (if return_maps).
    \item groups: factor of group labels for each subject.
    \item mask_indices: indices used to vectorize maps.
    \item map_type: "volume" or "surface".
    \item data: subject-by-voxel matrix (if return_data).

\description{
\strong{Raison d'etre.}
Spatial NMF factorizes a non-negative subject-by-voxel matrix \eqn{X} into
\eqn{W} (subject loadings) and \eqn{H} (spatial components) such that
\eqn{X \approx W H}. \eqn{W} captures how strongly each subject expresses each
component, while \eqn{H} encodes spatially interpretable, additive patterns.
An optional graph Laplacian penalty encourages smooth, neuroanatomically
plausible components. The resulting representation is compact and supports
downstream inference (component tests, global CV tests, and stability).
}
\details{
\strong{Why not just voxelwise t-tests?}
Spatial NMF targets multivariate structure by learning \emph{patterns of
covarying voxels} rather than testing each voxel independently. This yields a
low-dimensional representation that is often more interpretable, statistically
powerful (fewer multiple comparisons), and robust to noise. With optional
spatial regularization, components are anatomically smoother than voxelwise
maps, and the framework provides component-level inference and stability
analyses that reflect network-level effects.

\strong{Interpreting inference outputs.}
\itemize{
  \item \emph{Component tests} (`spatial_nmf_component_test`): use `p_fwer` to
  identify components whose loadings differ reliably between groups; `p_unc`
  is uncorrected. `p_global` tests whether any component differs.
  \item \emph{Global test} (`spatial_nmf_global_test`): `stat` is cross-validated
  performance (AUC or accuracy) on component loadings; a significant `p_value`
  indicates a multivariate group difference without pinpointing a component.
  \item \emph{Stability} (`spatial_nmf_stability`): interpret `selection` as
  voxelwise stability (frequency among top-loadings), and `cv` as variability;
  higher `component_similarity` indicates stable component identity.

Convenience wrapper that converts lists of NeuroVol/NeuroSurface maps into
a subject-by-voxel matrix and fits spatially regularized NMF.
