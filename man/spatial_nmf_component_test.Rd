\usage{
spatial_nmf_component_test(
  fit = NULL,
  W = NULL,
  groups = NULL,
  covariates = NULL,
  test = c("two_group", "one_group"),
  nperm = 1000,

}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A spatial_nmf_fit object containing a W matrix.}

\item{W}{Optional n x k matrix of loadings (overrides fit$W).}

\item{groups}{Factor or vector of group labels (length n); required for two-group tests.}

\item{covariates}{Optional data frame of covariates (n rows).}

\item{test}{One of "two_group" or "one_group".}

\item{nperm}{Number of permutations (ignored for one_group if null_W provided).}

\item{correction}{One of "maxT" or "none".}

\item{alternative}{Alternative hypothesis: "two.sided" or "greater". For two_group
tests, "greater" evaluates positive differences for the second factor level
relative to the first.}

\item{null_W}{Null distribution of W for one-group inference (list or 3D array).}

\item{alpha}{Significance threshold for counting significant components.}

\item{seed}{Optional RNG seed for permutations.}

\item{return_perm}{Logical; return permutation statistics.}

\item{parallel}{Logical; use future_lapply for permutations (requires future.apply).}

\item{future_seed}{Optional seed control for future.apply (passed to future_lapply).}

\item{progress}{Logical; report progress via progressr (works with parallel futures).}
}
\value{
A list with a component-level results table and summary stats.

\description{
Tests whether subjects express NMF components differently between groups,
using the component loadings \eqn{W} from a spatial NMF fit. This is a
component-wise analysis (not voxelwise): each component gets a statistic and
a permutation p-value.
}
\details{
For two-group inference, the function fits a linear model for each component
(group plus optional covariates) and uses label permutations to build a null
distribution of the component-level t-statistics. For one-group inference,
the user supplies a null distribution of \eqn{W} (e.g., from permuted fits)
and the observed component means are compared to that null.

Use this when you want to identify which components show reliable group
differences in expression, rather than testing individual voxels.


\itemize{
  \item \code{stat} is the component-level test statistic (t-statistic for
  two-group tests; mean loading for one-group tests).
  \item \code{p_unc} is the uncorrected permutation p-value.
  \item \code{p_fwer} applies maxT family-wise error correction across components.
  \item \code{p_global} tests whether any component is significant.
