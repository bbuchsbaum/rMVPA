\title{Add Interaction Contrasts to an msreve_design}
\usage{
add_interaction_contrasts(design, pairs = NULL, orthogonalize = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{An object of class \code{msreve_design}.}

\item{pairs}{Optional two-column matrix or list of character vectors
specifying pairs of contrast column names. Default \code{NULL} uses all
pairwise combinations.}

\item{orthogonalize}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} (default) the expanded contrast
matrix is passed through \code{\link{orthogonalize_contrasts}}.}
}
\value{
The updated \code{msreve_design} object with non-zero interaction 
  columns appended. Zero interactions are automatically skipped.
}
\description{
Creates new contrast columns representing pairwise interactions of existing
contrasts in an \code{msreve_design} object. Interactions are computed as
element-wise products of the contrast vectors.
}
\details{
Interaction contrasts are created by element-wise multiplication of pairs
of contrast vectors. If the resulting interaction is a zero vector (which
occurs when the original contrasts have non-overlapping support, i.e., no
conditions where both contrasts are non-zero), the interaction is skipped
with an informative message. This commonly happens with contrasts that
compare distinct subsets of conditions, such as c(1,-1,0,0) and c(0,0,1,-1).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Example with non-overlapping contrasts (zero interaction)
C1 <- matrix(c(1,-1,0,0, 0,0,1,-1), nrow=4, 
             dimnames=list(NULL, c("A","B")))
# A compares conditions 1 vs 2, B compares 3 vs 4
# Their interaction will be zero and skipped

# Example with overlapping contrasts (non-zero interaction)  
C2 <- matrix(c(1,1,-1,-1, 1,-1,1,-1), nrow=4,
             dimnames=list(NULL, c("Main1","Main2")))
# These contrasts overlap and will produce a meaningful interaction
}
