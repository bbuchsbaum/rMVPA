\title{Naive Cross-Decoding (correlation to source prototypes)}
\usage{
naive_xdec_model(
  dataset,
  design,
  link_by = NULL,
  return_predictions = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{mvpa_dataset with train_data (source) and test_data (target)}

\item{design}{mvpa_design with y_train/y_test and optional `link_by` column
present in both train/test designs. If `link_by` is NULL, prototypes are
formed by the training labels `y_train` and evaluated against `y_test`.}

\item{link_by}{Optional character; if provided, prototypes and observed labels
are keyed by this column instead of y.}

\item{return_predictions}{logical; keep per-ROI predictions.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
model spec object of class `naive_xdec_model` for use with
  `run_regional()` or `run_searchlight()`.
}
\description{
Baseline analysis that classifies target-domain trials by correlating them
directly with source-domain prototypes (means over repeats) without any
adaptation. Serves as a comparator for REMAP-RRR.
}
\details{
The term "naive" is a technical designation meaning "without domain adaptation"
(i.e., direct prototype matching). It serves as the principled baseline for
evaluating domain-adaptive methods like REMAP-RRR. Also known as "zero-shot
transfer" or "direct transfer" in machine learning literature.
