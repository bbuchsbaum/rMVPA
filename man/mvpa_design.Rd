}
\arguments{
\item{train_design}{A data frame containing the training design matrix}

\item{test_design}{Optional data frame containing the test design matrix (default: NULL)}

\item{y_train}{Formula or vector specifying the training response variable (old path;
mutually exclusive with \code{cv_labels})}

\item{y_test}{Optional formula or vector specifying the test response variable (default: NULL)}

\item{block_var}{Optional formula or vector specifying the blocking variable for cross-validation}

\item{split_by}{Optional formula or vector for splitting analyses}

\item{cv_labels}{Optional vector of labels used for cross-validation fold construction
(new path; mutually exclusive with \code{y_train}). If provided without \code{targets},
\code{targets} defaults to \code{cv_labels}.}

\item{targets}{Optional vector of model-specific training targets. Defaults to \code{cv_labels}
when \code{cv_labels} is supplied, or to the parsed \code{y_train} when the old path is used.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
An \code{mvpa_design} object (S3 class) containing:
  \describe{
    \item{train_design}{Data frame of training design}
    \item{test_design}{Data frame of test design (if provided)}
    \item{cv_labels}{Labels used for cross-validation fold construction}
    \item{targets}{Model-specific training targets}
    \item{y_train}{Alias for \code{cv_labels} (for backward compatibility)}
    \item{y_test}{Test response variable (if provided)}
    \item{block_var}{Blocking variable for cross-validation (if provided)}
    \item{split_by}{Splitting factor (if provided)}
  }
}
\description{
Creates a design object for MVPA analysis that encapsulates training and testing designs,
response variables, and optional blocking and splitting factors.
}
\details{
The \code{y_train} and \code{y_test} can be specified either as formulas (e.g., ~ condition)
or as vectors. If formulas are used, they are evaluated within the respective design matrices.

The \code{block_var} and \code{split_by} can also be specified as formulas or vectors.
If formulas, they are evaluated within the training design matrix.

The new \code{cv_labels} and \code{targets} parameters allow separating the labels used
for fold construction from the actual training targets. When using the old \code{y_train}
path, both \code{cv_labels} and \code{targets} are set to the parsed \code{y_train} value.

# Basic design with only training data
train_df <- data.frame(condition = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 50),
                       block = rep(1:5, each = 20),
                       group = rep(c("Group1", "Group2"), 50))
design <- mvpa_design(train_df, y_train = ~ condition)

# Design with test data and blocking variable
test_df <- data.frame(condition = rep(c("A", "B"), each = 25))
design_with_test <- mvpa_design(
  train_df,
  test_df,
  y_train = ~ condition,
  y_test = ~ condition,
  block_var = ~ block

# Design with split_by factor
