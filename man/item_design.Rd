\title{Construct an ITEM design for trial-wise decoding}
\usage{
item_design(
  train_design = NULL,
  X_t,
  T_target,
  run_id,
  C_transform = NULL,
  V = NULL,
  v_type = c("cov", "precision"),
  trial_id = NULL,
  trial_hash = NULL,
  split_by = NULL,
  Z = NULL,
  Nuisance = NULL,
  meta = list(),

)
}
\arguments{
\item{train_design}{Data frame/tibble describing TR-level observations.
If `NULL`, a minimal design with one row per TR is created.}

\item{X_t}{Numeric trial-wise design matrix (`n_time x n_trials`).}

\item{T_target}{Trial-level supervised targets (matrix/data.frame/vector/factor).
Length/rows must equal `n_trials`.}

\item{run_id}{Trial-level run/session identifiers (length `n_trials`).}

\item{C_transform}{Optional trial-to-condition transform matrix.}

\item{V}{Optional temporal covariance/precision passed to `fmrilss::item_compute_u()`.}

\item{v_type}{One of `"cov"` or `"precision"`.}

\item{trial_id}{Optional trial identifiers.}

\item{trial_hash}{Optional trial hash used by alignment guards.}

\item{split_by}{Optional split variable passed to `mvpa_design()`.}

\item{Z}{Optional nuisance matrix (`n_time x q`) used by LS-A (`fmrilss::lsa`).}

\item{Nuisance}{Alias nuisance matrix for LS-A; if both provided, `Z` is used.}

\item{meta}{Optional metadata list.}

\item{...}{Reserved for forward compatibility.}
}
\value{
An object of class `c("item_design", "mvpa_design", "list")`.
}
\description{
Creates a design object for ITEM-style decoding where the trial-wise design
matrix (`X_t`) and supervised trial targets (`T_target`) are decoupled from
TR-level observations used in searchlight/ROI extraction.
