\arguments{
\item{onsets}{numeric vector of event onsets in seconds}

\item{durations}{optional numeric vector of event durations in seconds (scalar or length N). Default 0 (impulse).}

\item{run}{optional vector of run/block identifiers}

\item{TR}{repetition time in seconds (required)}

\item{hrf}{character: one of \code{"spm"}, \code{"glover"}, or \code{"gamma"}}

\item{oversampling}{integer oversampling factor relative to TR (default 16)}

\item{length_s}{numeric length of HRF kernel in seconds (default 32)}

\item{similarity}{one of \code{"overlap"} (cosine similarity) or \code{"corr"}}

\item{metric}{return type: \code{"distance"} or \code{"similarity"} (default \code{"distance"})}

\item{within_blocks_only}{logical; if TRUE zero-out cross-run entries (default TRUE)}

\item{normalize}{one of \code{"rank"}, \code{"z"}, or \code{"none"}}

\item{as_dist}{logical; if TRUE return a \code{dist} object (default TRUE)}
}
\value{
A \code{dist} object or symmetric matrix (N x N)
}
\description{
Builds a temporal confound RDM based on predicted HRF overlap between events.
Each event is convolved with a canonical HRF and pairwise similarity is computed
as either normalized overlap (cosine similarity) or Pearson correlation. The
result can be returned as a distance-like quantity suitable for regression.
