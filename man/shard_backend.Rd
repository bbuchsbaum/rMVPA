\title{Experimental Shared-Memory Backend for Parallel MVPA}
\description{
Uses the \pkg{shard} package to place the full data matrix in POSIX shared
memory, enabling zero-copy parallel ROI extraction across \pkg{furrr} workers.
Activated per model spec via \code{\link{use_shard}}.
}
\details{
When enabled, the default serial ROI-extraction loop in
\code{\link{mvpa_iterate}} is skipped.
Instead, each worker receives lightweight ALTREP handles that point into the
shared-memory segment and extracts its own ROI columns on demand.
This eliminates the two main memory bottlenecks of the default pipeline:
\enumerate{
  \item Serial \code{extract_roi()} in the main process.
  \item Serialisation of large ROI matrices to workers via \pkg{furrr}.
}
}
\section{Supported dataset types}{

\itemize{
  \item \code{mvpa_image_dataset} (volumetric)
  \item \code{mvpa_surface_dataset} (cortical surface)
  \item \code{mvpa_clustered_dataset} (parcellated)
}
}

\section{Cleanup}{

Shared-memory segments are released automatically at the end of
\code{mvpa_iterate()}.
You can also call \code{shard_cleanup(mod_spec$shard_data)} explicitly.
