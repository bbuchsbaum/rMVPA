\title{Apply Transformations to an Existing Contrast Matrix}
\usage{
transform_contrasts(
  C,
  centre = TRUE,
  scale = c("none", "sd", "l2"),
  orth = FALSE,
  keep_attr = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{C}{A numeric matrix representing the contrasts (conditions x contrasts).
Row names, if present, should correspond to condition labels and will be preserved.
Column names, if present, will be used for the `"source"` attribute if
`orth = TRUE` and `keep_attr = TRUE`.}

\item{centre}{Logical. If TRUE (default), columns of the matrix are mean-centered.}

\item{scale}{Character string specifying scaling method after centering (if `orth=FALSE`).
Options: `"none"` (default), `"sd"` (divide by sample standard deviation),
`"l2"` (divide by L2 norm / vector length to get unit vectors).
This argument is *ignored* if `orth = TRUE`.}

\item{orth}{Logical. If FALSE (default), the matrix columns represent the specified
contrasts directly (after centering/scaling).
If TRUE, an orthonormal basis for the column space is computed via QR decomposition.
Resulting columns will be orthogonal and have unit length (L2 norm = 1).}

\item{keep_attr}{Logical. If TRUE (default) and `orth = TRUE`, the original column
names (before orthogonalization) are stored in `attr(C_transformed, "source")`,
and names of linearly dependent columns removed during orthogonalization are
stored in `attr(C_transformed, "dropped")`.}
}
\value{
A transformed numeric matrix. If `orth = TRUE` and `keep_attr = TRUE`,
  it includes `"source"` and potentially `"dropped"` attributes.
}
\description{
Applies centering, scaling, and/or orthogonalization to a pre-existing
numeric contrast matrix.
}
\details{
This function is useful for post-processing a contrast matrix, especially one
that might have been created by combining outputs from different sources
(e.g., theory-driven contrasts and data-driven contrasts) or by direct
manual construction.
}
\section{Scaling}{

Applied *after* centering if `orth=FALSE`.
\itemize{
  \item `"none"`: No scaling.
  \item `"sd"`: `scale(..., center=FALSE, scale=TRUE)`. Uses sample standard deviation (N-1 denominator).
        Note that for columns with few unique values (e.g., a centered +/-1 contrast), the SD
        can be slightly different depending on whether the number of items is even or odd,
        due to the N-1 denominator. This might lead to minor differences in scaled norms.
  \item `"l2"`: Divides each column by its L2 norm (`sqrt(sum(x^2))`).
}
}

\section{Orthogonalization}{

If `orth = TRUE`, uses `qr.Q(qr(C))` to find an orthonormal basis. The number of columns
in the output will be the rank of the input matrix. Columns are renamed `Orth1`, `Orth2`, etc.
Scaling is ignored as the columns already have unit L2 norm.
If `keep_attr = TRUE`:
  `attr(C_orth, "source")` stores the names of the original columns
  that formed the basis for the orthogonalized matrix.
  `attr(C_orth, "dropped")` stores the names of original columns that were
  linearly dependent and thus not part of the basis, if any.
}

\section{Specific Behaviors}{

\itemize{
  \item If `orth = TRUE` and the input matrix has only one column after potential centering,
        that column is scaled to unit L2 norm. Centering still depends on the `centre` argument.
  \item If `centre = FALSE` and `orth = TRUE`, the QR decomposition is performed on the
        *uncentered* columns.
  \item If the mini-DSL `. ` notation is used for `levelsB` and `levelsA` already contains
        all `labels`, `levelsB` becomes empty, potentially resulting in a constant (zero)
        column before centering. A warning is issued in this case.
