}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Optional spatial_nmf_maps_result with return_data=TRUE.}

\item{X}{Optional subject-by-voxel matrix (overrides x$data).}

\item{groups}{Factor or vector of group labels (length n).}

\item{k}{Number of components (defaults to x$fit$k if available).}

\item{lambda}{Spatial regularization strength (defaults to x$fit$lambda if available).}

\item{graph}{Optional graph Laplacian list (required if lambda > 0). If `graph$A`
is weighted, set `graph$weighted=TRUE` to preserve weights; otherwise edges are binarized.}

\item{neighbors}{Neighborhood size for volumetric adjacency (6/18/26).}

\item{nfolds}{Number of cross-validation folds.}

\item{folds}{Optional fold specification (vector of fold IDs or list of test indices).
If NULL, folds are stratified by `groups`.}

\item{nperm}{Number of label permutations.}

\item{permute}{Permutation strategy: "labels" permutes labels with fixed folds
and fixed NMF projections; "full" re-derives folds based on permuted labels
and refits NMF within each fold. If `folds` is supplied, "full" falls back to
"labels" (fixed folds).}

\item{metric}{Performance metric: "auc" or "accuracy".}

\item{classifier}{Classifier: "glm", "lda", or "centroid".}

\item{scale}{Logical; z-score W within each fold.}

\item{positive}{Optional positive class label (defaults to second factor level).}

\item{seed}{Optional RNG seed.}

\item{project_args}{List of arguments passed to spatial_nmf_project.}

\item{return_perm}{Logical; return permutation statistics.}

\item{return_cv}{Logical; return cross-validated predictions and fold IDs.}

\item{parallel}{Logical; use future_lapply for permutations (requires future.apply).}

\item{future_seed}{Optional seed control for future.apply (passed to future_lapply).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to spatial_nmf_fit.}
}
\value{
A list with the observed statistic, permutation p-value, and metadata.

\description{
Tests whether groups are distinguishable in component space, without
attributing the effect to any single component. This is a multivariate,
cross-validated test: for each fold, NMF is fit on the training data and
component loadings for held-out subjects are used to train/test a classifier.
Permuting group labels yields a null distribution for the chosen metric
(AUC or accuracy).
}
\details{
Use this when you want a single omnibus test of group separability in the
learned component space.


\itemize{
  \item \code{stat} is the cross-validated performance (AUC or accuracy).
  \item \code{p_value} is the permutation p-value under the chosen strategy.
  \item \code{permute = "labels"} keeps folds fixed; \code{"full"} re-derives
  folds and refits NMF for each permutation (more expensive).
