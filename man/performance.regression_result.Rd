\title{Calculate Performance Metrics for Regression Result}
\usage{
\method{performance}{regression_result}(x, split_list, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{regression_result} object.}

\item{split_list}{Split results by indexed sub-groups (not supported for regression analyses yet).}
}
\value{
A named vector with the calculated performance metrics: R-squared, RMSE, and Spearman correlation.
}
\description{
This function calculates performance metrics for a regression result object, including R-squared, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Spearman correlation.
}
\details{
The function calculates the following performance metrics for the given regression result object:
- R-squared: proportion of variance in the observed data that is predictable from the fitted model.
- RMSE: root mean squared error, a measure of the differences between predicted and observed values.
- Spearman correlation: a measure of the monotonic relationship between predicted and observed values.
