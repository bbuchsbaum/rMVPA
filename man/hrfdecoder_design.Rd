\title{Construct an hrfdecoder design (explicit mvpa_design extension)}
\usage{
hrfdecoder_design(event_model, events, block_var, split_by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{event_model}{An event model object (e.g., from fmridesign::event_model).
This must include a sampling_frame attribute defining the TR structure.}

\item{events}{A data.frame/tibble of trial/event rows with event-level labels.
Must contain columns: `onset` (event onset times in seconds), `condition`
(factor or character labels).}

\item{block_var}{Integer/factor vector of length T (TRs) specifying run/block ids.}

\item{split_by}{Optional formula or vector to define split groups (passed to mvpa_design).}
}
\value{
An object inheriting from mvpa_design with explicit class `hrfdecoder_design`
        and additional fields `$event_model` and `$events`.
}
\description{
Creates a specialized design object for continuous-time decoding that carries
event metadata in addition to the fields required by `mvpa_design`.
}
\details{
This constructor avoids adding ad-hoc members to a plain `mvpa_design` by
returning an object with class `c("hrfdecoder_design", "mvpa_design", "list")`.

The hrfdecoder approach operates on continuous TR-level data rather than
trial-level beta estimates. The `y_train` field is a dummy variable (TR indices
1:T) used only for length validation and subsetting in the cross-validation
machinery. Critically, fold assignment is determined by `block_var` (run IDs),
NOT by `y_train` values. The actual decoding targets come from the `event_model`
and `events` fields, and `train_model.hrfdecoder_model()` ignores the `y`
parameter entirely.

# Create event table
events_df <- data.frame(
  onset = c(5, 15, 35, 45),

# Define sampling frame (TR structure)
sframe <- sampling_frame(blocklens = c(60, 60), TR = 2)

# Build event model

  data = events_df,
  block = ~run,
  sampling_frame = sframe
)

# Create hrfdecoder design
block_var <- rep(1:2, each = 60)  # 60 TRs per run
design <- hrfdecoder_design(
  event_model = evmod,
  events = events_df,
  block_var = block_var
)
