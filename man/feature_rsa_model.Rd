\title{Create a Feature-Based RSA Model}
\usage{
feature_rsa_model(
  dataset,
  design,
  method = c("scca", "pls", "pca"),
  crossval = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataset}{An \code{mvpa_dataset} object containing the neural data (X).}

\item{design}{A \code{feature_rsa_design} object specifying the feature space (F).}

\item{method}{Character string specifying the analysis method. One of:
\describe{
  \item{scca}{Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis}
  \item{pls}{Partial Least Squares}
  \item{pca}{Principal Component Analysis + linear regression on F}
}}

\item{crossval}{Optional cross-validation specification.}
}
\value{
A \code{feature_rsa_model} object (S3 class).
}
\description{
Creates a model for feature-based Representational Similarity Analysis (RSA) that relates neural patterns
(X) to a predefined feature space (F).
}
\details{
Feature RSA models analyze the relationship between neural patterns X and a predefined feature space F.
Methods:
  - scca: Finds canonical correlations between X and F and reconstructs F from X via these canonical directions.
  - pls: Uses partial least squares regression to predict F from X.
  - pca: PCA on X, then regress F_sc ~ PC(X_sc) for prediction.
