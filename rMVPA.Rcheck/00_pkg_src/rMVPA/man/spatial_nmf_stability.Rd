\arguments{
\item{x}{A spatial_nmf_maps_result or spatial_nmf_fit object.}

\item{X}{Optional data matrix (n x p) if not included in x.}

\item{fit}{Optional spatial_nmf_fit object (if x is not provided).}

\item{graph}{Optional graph Laplacian list (required if lambda > 0).}

\item{lambda}{Spatial regularization strength (defaults to fit$lambda).}

\item{n_boot}{Number of bootstrap samples.}

\item{sample}{One of "bootstrap" or "subsample".}

\item{sample_frac}{Fraction of subjects to sample.}

\item{init}{NMF initialization for bootstrap fits.}

\item{fast}{Logical; use faster defaults for each bootstrap fit (e.g., random init,
fewer iterations). You can still override specific optimization settings via `...`.}

\item{normalize}{Component normalization ("H" rescales rows to sum 1).}

\item{similarity}{Similarity measure for component matching ("cosine" or "cor").}

\item{match}{Matching strategy (currently "greedy").}

\item{top_frac}{Fraction of top voxels used to compute selection frequency.}

\item{seed}{Optional RNG seed.}

\item{return_maps}{Logical; return stability maps as NeuroVol/NeuroSurface.}

\item{parallel}{Logical; use future_lapply for bootstrap resamples (requires future.apply).}

\item{future_seed}{Optional seed control for future.apply (passed to future_lapply).}

\item{progress}{Logical; report progress via progressr (works with parallel futures).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to spatial_nmf_fit.}
}
\value{
A list with stability summaries and optional maps.
}
\description{
Quantifies how stable the learned component maps are to resampling subjects.
For each bootstrap (or subsample), the NMF is re-fit, components are matched
to the reference solution, and summary maps are accumulated.
}
\details{
Use this to assess whether components are reproducible and which voxels are
consistently among the strongest loadings.


\itemize{
  \item \code{mean}, \code{sd}, \code{cv}: bootstrap mean/SD/CV of component maps.
  \item \code{selection}: frequency with which a voxel appears in the top fraction.
  \item \code{component_similarity}: average similarity to the reference components.
