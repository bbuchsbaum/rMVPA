\usage{
crossv_bootstrap_block(
  data,
  y,
  block_var,
  nreps = 5,
  id = ".id",
  weights = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the training data.}

\item{y}{A response vector.}

\item{block_var}{An integer vector defining the cross-validation blocks.}

\item{nreps}{An integer specifying the number of bootstrap repetitions.}

\item{id}{A character string specifying the identifier for the output data frame.}

\item{weights}{An optional numeric vector of weights to be used for bootstrap sampling.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the training and testing data, response vectors, and block IDs for each fold.
}
\description{
This function prepares the data for block bootstrap cross-validation by dividing the dataset
based on the provided block variable. It creates subsets of training and testing
data for each block using bootstrap sampling within the training blocks, without performing any analysis or fitting models.
}
\details{
The function first checks if the length of the `block_var` vector matches the length of the response vector `y`.
It then creates a list of block indices and ensures there is more than one block to bootstrap. If weights are provided,
the function splits the weights according to the block variable.

The function performs bootstrap sampling within the training blocks but keeps the test set fixed.
For each block, it generates a list of training indices using bootstrap sampling and creates the corresponding
training and testing data sets.
