\title{Merge results for vector RSA model}
\usage{
\method{merge_results}{vector_rsa_model}(obj, result_set, indices, id, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{The vector RSA model specification (contains nperm etc.).}

\item{result_set}{A tibble from the processor. Expected to contain the output
of `train_model.vector_rsa_model` (the scores vector) likely within `$result[[1]]`.}

\item{indices}{Voxel indices for the current ROI/searchlight sphere.}

\item{id}{Identifier for the current ROI/searchlight center.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments.}
}
\value{
A tibble row with the final performance metrics for the ROI/sphere.
}
\description{
Aggregates results (scores) and calls evaluate_model.
Vector RSA typically doesn't involve folds in the same way as classifiers,
so this mainly formats the output of train_model for the specific ROI/sphere.
