\title{Define consecutive column blocks as feature sets}
\usage{
blocks(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Named integers giving number of columns per set (must sum to `ncol(X)`).}
}
\value{
An object of class `feature_set_spec_blocks`.
}
\description{
Convenience constructor for the common case where columns are arranged as
consecutive blocks (e.g., low/mid/high/sem PCs concatenated).
}
\details{
`blocks()` does not touch any data; it only declares how columns should be
interpreted when passed to `feature_sets()`.
}
\examples{
spec <- blocks(low = 100, mid = 100, high = 100, sem = 100)
}
