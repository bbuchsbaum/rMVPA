\title{Representational connectivity design helper (ReNA-RC)}
\usage{
repnet_design(design, key_var, seed_rdm, confound_rdms = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{design}{An \code{mvpa_design} object (as used elsewhere in rMVPA).}

\item{key_var}{Column name or formula giving item identity (e.g. \code{~ ImageID}).}

\item{seed_rdm}{A K x K matrix or \code{"dist"} object; rows/cols labelled by item IDs.}

\item{confound_rdms}{Optional named list of K x K matrices or \code{"dist"} objects,
used as nuisance RDMs (e.g. block, lag, behavior).}
}
\value{
A list with fields:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{key}: factor of item IDs (length = nrow(design$train_design))
    \item \code{seed_rdm}: seed RDM as a matrix with row/colnames
    \item \code{confound_rdms}: named list of confound RDM matrices
  }
}
\description{
Build a design object for representational connectivity, specifying item keys,
a seed RDM, and optional confound RDMs.
}
