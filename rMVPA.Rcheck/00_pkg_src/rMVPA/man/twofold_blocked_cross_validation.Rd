\title{twofold_blocked_cross_validation}
\usage{
twofold_blocked_cross_validation(block_var, nreps = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{block_var}{An integer vector representing the cross-validation blocks. Each block is indicated by a unique integer.}

\item{nreps}{An integer specifying the number of repetitions for the twofold split.}
}
\value{
An object of class "twofold_blocked_cross_validation", "cross_validation", and "list" containing the block_var,
  nfolds (fixed at 2 for this function), nreps, and block_ind.
}
\description{
Construct a cross-validation specification that randomly partitions the input set into two sets of blocks.
}
\details{
This function creates a cross-validation scheme for cases where data is organized into blocks, and these blocks
are divided into two groups for evaluation. This approach can be useful when there is an inherent structure or
dependency within the blocks, and separating them can help to avoid biased estimates of model performance.
It returns an object of class "twofold_blocked_cross_validation", "cross_validation", and "list".

\examples{
blockvar <- rep(1:5, each=10)
nreps <- 5
cval <- twofold_blocked_cross_validation(blockvar, nreps=nreps)
samples <- crossval_samples(cval, as.data.frame(matrix(rnorm(50*50),50,50)), y=rep(letters[1:5],10))
stopifnot(nrow(samples) == nreps)
