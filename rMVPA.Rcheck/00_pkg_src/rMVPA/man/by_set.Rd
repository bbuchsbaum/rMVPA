\alias{by_set}
\title{Define feature sets by a per-column set label}
\usage{
by_set(set, order = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{set}{Character or factor vector of length ncol(X), naming the set for each column.}

\item{order}{Optional character vector giving the desired set order.}
}
\value{
An object of class `feature_set_spec_by`.
}
\description{
Use this when columns are not arranged as contiguous blocks.
}
\details{
This is useful when:
\itemize{
  \item you have interleaved predictors (e.g. time-lagged features),
  \item you want to group columns by an external annotation, or
  \item you already have column names encoding the set membership.
}
}
\examples{
X <- matrix(rnorm(10 * 6), 10, 6)
set <- rep(c("audio", "vision"), each = 3)
fs <- feature_sets(X, by_set(set, order = c("vision", "audio")))
fs
}
